# COMMAND LINE INTERFACE (CLI) DICTIONARY APP

The Command Line Interface (CLI) Dictionary is a web-based app designed to assist users in searching for the meanings of frequently used commands and terms in shell environments and text editors. This app features a comprehensive list of commands utilized in vi, emacs, and git. The app provides a quick and easy way for users to access the definitions of frequently used commands and terms without leaving their terminal.
